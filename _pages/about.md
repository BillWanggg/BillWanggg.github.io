I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Paula and Gregory Chow Institute for Studies in Economics, Xiamen University, China, and expect to graduate in Winter 2026. My research focuses on the interactions between fiscal and monetary policies and their implications for macroeconomic stability. I am also interested in the role of fiscal policy in fostering long-run economic growth.
