PhD Student in Economics - London Business School

I am a sixth year Economics PhD student at London Business School, on the job market 2024/25. My research agenda explores how heterogeneity can affect macroeconomic outcomes, particularly in the face of growing challenges presented by climate change.

**_Inequalities in Insuring Climate Risks_** (JMP)

Climate change is expected to lead to more frequent and severe extreme weather events. This paper examines how households anticipate and mitigate their exposure to these risks through adaptive investments and insurance, using an administrative dataset from the US National Flood Insurance Program covering over 70 million insurance policies. Following an increase in flood risk awareness, households in higher income areas are more likely to invest in adaptation, while households in poorer areas tend to rely more heavily on insurance. To explore the implications of these dynamics, I develop a heterogeneous agent model of climate risk, where households make decisions on adaptation and insurance to protect their housing stock amidst a gradual rise in climate risk. Lower income, financially constrained households are slower to invest in adaptation, leading to greater and more unequal economic damage from climate change. Moving away from the current subsidisation of insurance could increase resilience to climate risk.

[Non-essential Business Cycles](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f202255.pdf), with Michele Andreolli and Paolo Surico

Using newly constructed time series of consumption, prices and earnings in essential and non-essential sectors, we document three main empirical regularities on post-WWII U.S. data: (i) spending on non-essentials is more sensitive to the business-cycle than spending on essentials; (ii) earnings in non-essential sectors are more cyclical than in essential sectors; (iii) low-earners are more likely to work in non-essential industries. We develop and estimate a structural model with non-homothetic preferences over two expenditure goods, hand-to-mouth consumers and heterogeneity in labour productivity that is consistent with these findings. We use the model to revisit the transmission of monetary policy and find that the interaction of cyclical product demand composition and cyclical labour demand composition greatly amplifies business-cycle fluctuations.

[The Green Energy Transition in a Putty-Clay Model of Capital](http://nrickard.github.io/files/GreenTransitionPuttyClay_GilchristMartinezRickard_Oct24.pdf), with Simon Gilchrist and Joseba Martinez

We develop an integrated assessment model (IAM) that incorporates a putty-clay technology for capital accumulation in both the energy and final goods sectors. Final-goods production requires energy inputs that are produced by either a fossil-fuel burning sector or a clean energy sector. Following the IAM literature, fossil fuel usage leads to an accumulation of carbon that reduces aggregate production through a climate damage function that is external to the choices made by households and firms. The putty-clay features of the model imply delayed adjustment of fossil-fuel use to carbon taxes. Because of these delays, the carbon tax must be forty percent larger in the putty-clay model relative to a more standard model of vintage capital to meet the same carbon stock goals over a thirty year horizon. Green energy subsidies are also effective in reducing carbon stocks in the medium run but have a lower impact on longer-term fossil fuel use compared to carbon taxes of comparable size.
